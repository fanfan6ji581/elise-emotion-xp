                    The computer will randomly select 100 consecutive trials out of the 300 trials youâ€™re going to play, and will compute the accumulated outcomes from those selected trials. What you will receive at the end of the experiment is a percentage of those accumulated outcomes (not the whole amount as we cannot afford to pay you more than $100 ðŸ˜„), minus a threshold.

                    We have fixed the percentage and threshold parameters to ensure that a sophisticated player is almost guaranteed to leave the lab with more than $80 AUD, and highly likely to get the max payment of $100 AUD. In contrast, if you do not implement the optimal strategy for the task, your most likely payoff from the task will be $5 AUD. The reason for such a payment rule is that we want to incentivise you to master the game ðŸ˜„.

                    <strong>Note:</strong> We will tell you the value of the percentage and threshold only after youâ€™ve completed the task because the knowledge of these values beforehand could disturb you during the game and we want you to focus on doing your best on every single trial â€” recall that any trial could be selected for payment by the computer.
