                In this game, there is a financial asset whose value fluctuates every day. Some days the value increases, some days it decreases, like this for example:

            <Grid item xs={2} />

              <Typography variant="h6" sx={{ my: 3 }}>
                A value of ‚Äú+1‚Äù for a given day indicates an <i>uptrend</i> : asset value has <i>increased</i> on that day (e.g, see Day # 5). A value ‚Äú-1‚Äù indicates a <i>downtrend</i>: asset value has <i>decreased</i> on that day (e.g., Day # 10).
              </Typography>
              <Typography variant="h6" sx={{ my: 3 }}>
                As you can see on the graph, the trend of the asset usually remains the same for several days, meaning the asset alternates between uptrend phases of and downtrend phases. For example, from Day #9 to Day #18, the asset features a downtrend; from Day #19 to Day #26, it features an uptrend. However, occasionally, the trend changes for only one day and then returns to its current level (see, for example, the downtrend on Day #2, or the uptrend on Day #35).

                Your job is to decide whether to take a position‚Äîeither buy or sell‚Äîin the asset in each of 300 days, so you will be playing 300 trials overall (1 trial = 1 day). If you do not want to take a position in the asset, you should choose to pass, which guarantees you to get $0 (i.e., you cannot lose any money, but you cannot win money either).

The action set looks like this on the user interface (you simply click on your chosen option on each trial):

                After you‚Äôve made your decision on a given day, you see the realization of the asset trend on the next day, and your corresponding outcome. Then you proceed immediately to the next trial (no break). The computer records all the outcomes you got across trials, and your final earnings directly reflect your net accumulated outcomes in the game, so you should really try to do your best on each trial, as you can potentially earn very significant earnings (more details below).
