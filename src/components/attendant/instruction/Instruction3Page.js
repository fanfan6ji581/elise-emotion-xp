                In this game, there is a financial asset whose value fluctuates every day. Some days the value increases, some days it decreases, like this for example:

              <Typography variant="h6" sx={{ my: 3 }}>
                A value of ‚Äú<b>+1</b>‚Äù for a given day indicates an <i>uptrend</i> : asset value has <i>increased</i> on that day (e.g, see Day # 5). A value ‚Äú<b>-1</b>‚Äù indicates a <i>downtrend</i>: asset value has <i>decreased</i> on that day (e.g., Day # 10).
              </Typography>
              <Typography variant="h6" sx={{ my: 3 }}>
                As you can see on the graph, the trend of the asset usually remains the same for several days,
                meaning the asset alternates between uptrend phases and downtrend phases. For example,
                from Day #9 to Day #18, the asset features a downtrend. Then on Day #19 a shift occurs and
                from Day #19 to Day #26, the asset features an uptrend. However, occasionally, the trend
                changes for only one day and then returns to its current level. For example, on Day #35, the
                asset switches to an uptrend but only for that day and then it switches back to the current
                downtrend. Thus, this is not a real shift but an ‚Äú<i>aberration</i>‚Äù, more below.

                Your job is to decide whether to take a position‚Äîeither buy or sell‚Äîin the asset in each of
                300 days, so you will be playing 300 trials overall (1 trial = 1 day). If you do not want to take
                position in the asset, you should choose to pass, which guarantees you to get $0 (i.e., you
                cannot lose any money, but you cannot win money either).

                buy 1 share or 2 shares; likewise in case of a sell decision: you tell the computer how many
                shares you want to sell. The action set looks like this on the user interface (you simply click

                What this means is that if you take a position on a shift day, you will win or lose $20 per

                After you‚Äôve made your decision on a given day, you see the realization of the asset trend on
                the next day, and your corresponding outcome. Then you proceed immediately to the next
                trial (no break). The computer records all the outcomes you got across trials and your final
                earnings directly reflect your net accumulated outcomes in the game, so you should really try
                to do your best on each trial, as you can potentially earn very significant earnings (more
